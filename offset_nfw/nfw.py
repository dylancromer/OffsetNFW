class NFWModel(object):
    """
    A class that generates offset NFW halo profiles.  The basic purpose of this class is to generate
    internal interpolation tables for the common NFW lensing quantities, but it includes direct
    computation of the non-miscentered versions for completeness.
    
    Initializing a class is easy.  You do need a cosmology object like those created by astropy,
    since we need to know overdensities.  Once you have one:
    >>>  from offset_nfw import NFWModel
    >>>  nfw_model = NFWModel(cosmology)
    
    However, this won't have any internal interpolation tables (unless you've already created them
    in the directory you're working in).  To do that, you pass:
    >>>  nfw_model = NFWModel(generate=True)
    If you want to use tables you generated in another directory, that's easy:
    >>>  nfw_model = NFWModel(dir='nfw_tables')
    Note that setting ``generate=True`` will only generate new internal interpolation tables `if
    those tables do not already exist`.  If you want to `re`generate a table, you should delete
    the table files. They all start `.saved_nfw*` and use the extension `.npy`.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    cosmology : astropy.cosmology instance
        A cosmology object that can return distances and densities for computing sigma crit and
        rho_m or rho_c.  (Technically, this doesn't have to be an astropy.cosmology instance if it
        has the methods ``angular_diameter_distance``, ``angular_diameter_distance_z1z2``, and 
        ``efunc`` (=H(z)/H0)), plus the attributes ``critical_density0`` and ``Om0``,
    dir : str
        The directory where the saved tables should be stored (will be interpreted through
        ``os.path``). [default: '.']
    generate : boolean
        if True, generate tables; if False, try to read them from disk. [default: False]
    rho : str
        Which type of overdensity to use for the halo, 'rho_m' or 'rho_c'. [default: 'rho_m']
    comoving: bool
        Use comoving coordinates (True) or physical coordinates (False). [default: True]
    delta : float
        The overdensity at which the halo mass is defined [default: 200]
    precision : float
        The maximum allowable fractional error, defined for some mass range and concentration TBD
    x_range : tuple
        The min-max range of x (=r/r_s) for the interpolation table. Precision is not guaranteed for 
        values other than the default.  [default: (0.0003, 300)]
    miscentering_range : tuple
        The min-max range of the rescaled miscentering radius (=r_mis/r_s) for the interpolation 
        table. Precision is not guaranteed for values other than the default.
        [default: (0.0003, 300)]

            The radius or radii (in length, not angular, units) at which to evaluate the function.
            Whatever definition (comoving/not, etc) you used for your cosmology object should be
            replicated here.  This can be an object with astropy units of length; if not it is
            assumed to be in Mpc/h.
        M : float or iterable
            The mass of the halo at the overdensity definition given at class initialization. If
            this is an iterable, all other non-r parameters must be either iterables with the same
            length or floats. This can be an object with astropy units of mass; if not it is assumed
            to be in h Msun.
        c : float or iterable
            The concentration of the halo at the overdensity definition given at class 
            initialization.  If this is an iterable, all other non-r parameters must be either
            iterables with the same length or floats.
        r_mis : float or iterable
            The distance (in length units) between the reported center of the halo and the actual
            assumed to be in Mpc/h.

        Returns
        -------
        float or numpy.ndarray
            Returns the value of gamma at the requested parameters. If every parameter was a
            float, this is a float. If only r OR some of the non-r parameters were iterable, this is
            a 1D array with the same length as the iterable parameters.  If both r and another
            parameter were iterable, with the non-r parameter having shape ``(n1, n2, ..., nn)``
