class NFWModel(object):
    """
    A class that generates offset NFW halo profiles.  The basic purpose of this class is to generate
    internal interpolation tables for the common NFW lensing quantities, but it includes direct
    computation of the non-miscentered versions for completeness.
    
    Initializing a class is easy.  You do need a cosmology object like those created by astropy,
    since we need to know overdensities.  Once you have one:
    >>>  from offset_nfw import NFWModel
    >>>  nfw_model = NFWModel(cosmology)
    
    However, this won't have any internal interpolation tables (unless you've already created them
    in the directory you're working in).  To do that, you pass:
    >>>  nfw_model = NFWModel(generate=True)
    If you want to use tables you generated in another directory, that's easy:
    >>>  nfw_model = NFWModel(dir='nfw_tables')
    Note that setting ``generate=True`` will only generate new internal interpolation tables `if
    those tables do not already exist`.  If you want to `re`generate a table, you should delete
    the table files. They all start `.saved_nfw*` and use the extension `.npy`.

            The mass of the halo at the overdensity definition given at class initialization. If

        M : float or iterable
            The mass of the halo at the overdensity definition given at class initialization. If
            this is an iterable, all other non-r parameters must be either iterables with the same
            length or floats. This can be an object with astropy units of mass; if not it is assumed
            to be in h Msun.
        c : float or iterable
            The concentration of the halo at the overdensity definition given at class 
            initialization.  If this is an iterable, all other non-r parameters must be either
            iterables with the same length or floats.
        r_mis : float or iterable
            The distance (in length units) between the reported center of the halo and the actual
            assumed to be in Mpc/h.
            center of the halo.  Whatever definition (comoving/not, etc) you used for your cosmology
            object should be replicated here.  This can be an object with astropy units of length;
            if not it is assumed to be in Mpc/h.  If this is an iterable, all other non-r parameters
            must be either iterables with the same length or floats.
        
        Returns
        -------
        float or numpy.ndarray
            Returns the value of g at the requested parameters. If every parameter was a
            float, this is a float. If only r OR some of the non-r parameters were iterable, this is
            a 1D array with the same length as the iterable parameters.  If both r and another
            parameter were iterable, with the non-r parameter having shape ``(n1, n2, ..., nn)``
            (which of course may be only one item!), then this returns an array of shape
            ``(n1, n2, ..., nn, len(r))``.
